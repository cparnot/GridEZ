# GEZJob:
* Implemented different modes for retrieving job results. One can choose to only upload the streams, instead of all the files. The results can also be reset or "cleared". This functionality has been added to the GUI of the Xgrid panel as well. The implementation is not very flexible and will need to change at some point if more options are needed.
* "delegate" is a relationship for GEZJob
* property "isRunning" changed to "running"
* fixed bug:  would permaturely consider inexistant a just submitted job in some instances
* fixed bug: deletion by external application was not properly detected and notified to delegate
* changed implementation to take into account the fact that even after a job submission is successful (XGActionMonitor returns with success), the XGJob is not necessarily yet available in XGGrid, and we have to give XGGrid a chance to be updated before we can get the XGJob
* bug fix:  make sure the GEZGrid used for submission of a GEZJob is in the same managed object context, when using the setGrid: method

# GEZServer:
* Added "autoconnect" property of GEZServer, which will make the server try to autoconnect
* Properties "isAvailable"...etc... have been renamed "available"...etc... which is more inline with KVC conventions
* Added missing implementation of the convenience method 'submitJobWithSpecifications:' in GEZGrid and GEZServer. The previous implementation was just returning nil!!
* Now full support for live update of the list of all jobs in GEZGrid and GEZServer. This is done by having a switch in these objects called 'observeAllJobs', that can be turned on or off. This switch can also be set in the GUI in the Xgrid panel.
* Added support for storage of password in the user keychain


# GEZMetaJob (changes compared to GridStuffer initial implementation):
* Added GEZMetaJob class to the framework, coming from GridStuffer
* Smart submission to maximize controller usage and keep it responsive; this is possible by setting a maxNumberOfPendingJobs and maxNumberOfSubmittingJobs; this way, a controller can't become unresponsive as a result of submitting too many jobs; also, when some jobs are running and some pending, it means the grid is full, so we can stop submitting more
* Submission to several grids at the same time; responds automatically when a grid is added; only use connected grids for submissions, and use all the connected grids when no specific grid has been set using the 'grids' relationship
* Updated GEZMetaJob data model to have a 'tasksPerJob' attribute, instead of 'maxTasksPerJob' and 'minTasksPerJob'; the user simply decides how many tasks to put per job, when possible

#GEZManager and Core Data:
* Added a method to register additional managed object contexts with GEZManager, so that additional GEZServer objects are also present in the application-wide context. In theory, the user of the framework needs to register a context if she uses some GridEZ object.
* Added options set in the application Info.plist to enable/disable the NSUndoManager of the main managed object context (by default, disabled), and to allow different formats to be used for the corresponding store.
* GEZManager now creates a managed object context using all the managed object models available in the bundle.

# Misc:
* Removed some extraneous NSLog from the implementation of GEZIntegerArray
* Changed terminology: instead of being "Synced", an xgrid resource (job, server, grid) is said to be "Updated", to be consistent with Xgrid terminology. The only problem is that CoreData also has the concept of "isUpdated", so method names would clash if the classes inheriting from NSManagedObject were to implement the method "isUpdated". This was initially why I did not add these methods. I figured this is actually quite a small limitation. 
* GridEZ: renamed the entities in the Core Data model to be the same as the class name, instead of using the "GridEZ_" prefix.
* Added several calls to 'processPendingChanges' in the model code when inserting new entitites, mostly to force better updates in the GUI.
* Now using a better mechanism to determine when a resource is updated the first time it syncs with the controller; this makes use of a separate class GEZResourceObserver that keeps KVO on the key "updated" of an XGResource. This mechanism is used in GEZGridHook, GEZServerHook and GEZJob.
* bug fix:  jobSpecification would not always be released when needed in GEZJob after the submission. The fix was to simply release it right after submission to the XGController, and not wait for submission to be successful or to fail.
* bug fix:  when server disconnected while job is submitted, should do something to kill the submission. Bug was reported by James Reynolds,  and I need to check with him that the fix does the job. The fix works as follows: when a grid is finally chosen, get notified of server disconnection so we can invalidate the job if that happens while submission is still ongoing.
* Corrected a typo/bug : the identifier for the notifications GEZGridHookDidChangeNameNotification and GEZGridHookDidChangeJobsNotification were set to identical strings
* Systematically looked for potential memory leaks in the dealloc implementations. There were a bunch of them, yikes!


# User interface
* Controller Window: list grids under the controller using an NSOutlineView
* Controller Window: using a toolbar for connection, deconnection, adding/removing (the toolbar can't be hidden and the buttons can't be removed and reordered)
* Controller Window: the whole window is now just a list of servers; the user must use the '+' button to add more controllers
* Controller Window: removed extra column with last connection time (useless!)
* Connection dialogs are now done through a connection panel resembling the connection panel shown by the Finder when connecting to a server. Added Keychain support there.
* Controller Window and Xgrid Panel: allow double-clik of controller to trigger connections
* Controller Window and Xgrid Panel: added keyboard shortcut to use the 'Delete' key for deletion of servers and jobs
* Do not allow the user to add a server with address = empty string.
* XGrid Panel now shows the job ids in the job table view
* XGrid Panel allows to retrieve job results. One can choose to only upload the streams, instead of all the files. The results can also be reset or "cleared".
* Controller Window: "autoconnect" feature accessible thru contextual menu
* Xgrid panel: "autoconnect" feature accessible in inspector
