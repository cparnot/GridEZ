Roadmap

Todo for v0.4 release:
* bug when GEZGrid always observe jobs and a job is submitted: 2 instances are created!
* GEZJob delegate: make it a coredata relationship, just like the delegate of GEZMetaJob; do that at the end, because the database format will become incompatible
* all the keys "isAvailable", "isConnected",... should be replaced with "available", "connected",... to be KVC-compliant!!
* Make "autoconnect" a coredata property of GEZServer


done:
* Add "Autoconnect" to Server and Grid: first make it an ivar on GEZServerHook (and of GEZServer for testing and still be able to use  database compatible with previous version) then a coredata property of GEZServer
* In the Xgrid panel, add job ids and keep jobs ordered by ID by default: still buggy as the jobListController would need to be notified of changes in job attributes to trigger resorting
* delete key should work in Controllers window and Xgrid panel
* do not allow connection to empty string
* when job removed by other process, should get notified and act accordingly to remove job info from MetaJob
* GEZMetaJob bug: when grid becomes connected no new job submission even though they are expected
* change name of option "Observe all jobs" to "Only observe jobs submitted by application
* bug: happens when removing jobs. An instance 0x4f33e60 of class XGJob is being deallocated while key value observers are still registered with it.  Break on _NSKVODeallocateLog to start debugging
  行> I should use a separate object for each KVO instance to make it more like NSNotification system
* change the icons for the Controller window
* Add GEZMetaJob - this has to be done at the same time as GridStuffer changes
* Remove NSUndoManager (but still leaves it as an option to be set in the info.plist of the app bundle)
* Format of the store: make it an option to be set in the info.plist of the app bundle
* Add Keychain support
* bug: when server disconnected while job is submitted, should do something to kill the submission 行> check with James that the fix does the job
* allow GEZGrid to keep track and load _all_ jobs even not submitted by the app
* fix code in GEZGrid, method - (GEZJob *)submitJobWithSpecifications:(NSDictionary *)specs
* fix code in GEZServer, method - (GEZJob *)submitJobWithSpecifications:(NSDictionary *)specs
* Fix the Server Window to allow disconnect and make it slicker



---------------
Other things todo (some maybe):

* Add "Max Retrieving Jobs" to GEZMetaJob; do that at the end, because the database format will become incompatible

* GEZProxy bug: not properly saved the first time because of temporary ID issues
	* implement its own 'save' method in GEZManager that makes sure it saves again ih "hasChanges" = true
	* force-save when creating a GEZProxy
	* let the developer take care of it 行> right now this is what is done (see also GridStuffer)

* detect when a MetaJob is finished --> stop the timer and update statusString (and revert when changing some of the settings)
* In the Xgrid panel, keep jobs ordered by ID by default: still buggy as the jobListController would need to be notified of changes in job attributes to trigger resorting, which means we may need NSNotification from GEZJob
* User-level store, to remember servers used by different apps (do not store jobs)
* make the little colored dots for status more consistent in size (maybe different shapes?)

* add tests by using the examples that were developed for GridStuffer: the examples could be described by a plist, as they are now, but adding the expected results for the specifications

* Add the possibility to start a local Xgrid Controller (and have a dialog sheet come up if no server is detected around and no server in the database yet) 行> maybe use Xgrid Lite code, but GPL (Ed?)

* Have a system-wide database of servers, shared by all applications run by the user

* Do a better job at using CoreData callbacks for object creation, fetching, deletion,...

* Try to use some of XGResource methods and ivars like "isUpdated" and "actionMonitors", that would make my code simpler

* A job should be marked as deleted when deleted from the grid from outside --> need to observe its deletion in XGGrid; but maybe this is not a good idea to delete the GEZJob in fact (?)

* Put GUI stuff in separate headers, AppKit categories:
	* Controller window in GEZServer
	* Pasteboard name for drag and drop of GEZServer and GEZGrid (GEZServer and GEZGrid category too)

* GEZXgridPanelController could be made a subclass of GEZServerWindowController, but only do it if I make large changes, then they would share all the basic code

* GEZGridHook
	* monitor jobs to be considered 'loaded' --> right now, GEZGridHook objects NEVER GET "LOADED"
	* monitor state in case it goes away? Probably not necessary, if the server is monitoring its 'grids'

* GEZManager
	* Give the option to change the location of the persistent store
	* Remove the GUI stuff (see above)

* GEZServer
	* make the object smarter, so it remembers which way it connected before, e.g. not ask single sign on if already used that in the past --> how to make that work with GEZServerHook??
	* handle deletion in a smart way --> delete all server entities across mocs? allow deletion of connected servers? disconnect first?
	* still need to add code for GEZServer when grids added + support for observeAllJobs

* GEZJOb
	* when setServer is used, should defer the decision on the grid to the submission time, in case the default grid is changed by then

Todo for v0.3 release:
ALL DONE!

Done for v0.3 release:
* Finish GEZGridHook implementation
* Add code to handle GEZGridHook in GEZServerHook
* Test the implementation so far
* Add data model
* Add GEZManager --> how is the persistent store created?
* Add GEZServerBrowser
* Add GEZServer
* Add a nib + a window controller to bring a standard 'Xgrid Controller' window that can be used for connections
* Test that with a GUI
* Make the framework embeddable
* Add GEZGrid
* Test that with a GUI
* Make the server hook <--> grid hook interaction a delegate (or use the notifications)
* Add GEZJob
* Get the license messages right --> LPGL
* Update GEZJOb to have a complete interface to check state, including isSubmitting, is RetrievingResults, XGResourceState,...
* Update GEZJOb delegate method to be more consistent with state, e.g. jobDidSubmit instead of jobDidStart
* Get the context/server issue right: create new entities in the default context for *any* server added in *any* context:
